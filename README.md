# HumanAid-App
HumanAid can provide an invisible protective shield to the user. It will help
people to tackle emergencies and will monitor mainly women and child safety. The
basic idea is to build a user-friendly and robust application that can help individuals by
sending SOS messages along with the current location and the app can be triggered
with minimal effort.
